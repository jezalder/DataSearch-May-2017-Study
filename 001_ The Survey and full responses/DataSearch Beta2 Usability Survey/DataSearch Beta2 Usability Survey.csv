"2017/05/31 5:47:52 pm GMT","housing in Turkey","Yes, I found some interesting dataset on the topic","4","3","4","1","5","1","4","1","5","1","5","1","5","I would like to add some comments about your awesome tool.

1) I noticed that the when I search exact keywords enclosed in quotation marks like ""housing in Turkey"" or ""urban sprawl in Turkey"" in order to get more exact and relevant results, the engine returns nothing. Perhaps, it would be a good option to add advanced search option for exact searches. 
During my search I found 75121 results for ""housing in turkey"". Great return but it  is impossible to filter them according to relevance. I see some relevant results exist between pages of 20 and 30. But a lot of irrelevant query lay in the pages between 1 and 5.
For example Google Scholar offers such a search option, furthermore it also offers search option in the titles of publication thus narrowing down a query to more relevant results. Thus, by this options one can find the relevant data more quickly. For example I scrolled a lot, in order to find more relevant data to my query. But if the above noted options were added it would save a lot of time.

2) The second improvement I think would be adding topics, so that users can find relevant data quickly. For example my search term ""housing in Turkey"" is mostly related to urban planning and public administration topic, but I see a lot of data from non-related topics. So, if your search engine has a choice for narrowing down the results that would be great. For example, EBSCOhost database and Proquest have that option which helps a lot. They give an opportunity to narrow down the results according to the journal the paper is published and according to the field of study. For example in the case of ""housing in Turkey"" I can choose the results published in the journals like ""Habitat International"" or ""Urban Studies"".

3) Third, if your search engine is not going to have login and account options so that users can save queries and search results, it would be more proper if your interface contains save button or something like that so that they can export sources (not the data but metadata as a citation) into Mendeley or save as a spreadsheet and return to them later.

These were my initial comments about your data search tool.
Thank you!","10"

"2017/06/01 12:57:03 pm GMT","I work with Reaxys.   Big competitor is SciFinder.   Have done analysis of Rx/SF recently, so wanted to see how DataSearch went on similar searches:
1. Analysis of lycopene by HPLC
2. Analysis of carbamazepine in wastewater (and also the synthesis of carbamazepine)","Interesting data found.  However I had no idea what searches were done 'behind the scenes' and so could not find easily ways to revise the search (e.g., through addition of synonyms).   Also: 
- there didn't appear to be any post-processing options (by technical terms)
- I had no idea how the answers were sorted (although I assume by some relevance)  ... on a couple of the searches answers even on Page 2 didn't have anything to do with the terms searched","3","3","5","1","4","5","3","3","3","2","2","5","5","These were summed up in answers to the first question in the survey.  As an organic chemist (but I have also been a consultant in chemical information retrieval for over 30 years) the things that really matter to me are substances/properties and reactions.  However topics also are important - but you have to have systematic terms for topics.

It seems that DataSearch searches full text and, in chemistry, this is pretty limited because of the inability to search for structures, reactions, properties,  Besides, if you find a substance (or its property) then it's OK to read about the substance (property) in an article, but what else is known about the substance (or what other substances have such 'properties'?  Result: you need a substance database!   Similar for reactions/properties.

Besides the inability to search effectively in full text for structures, reactions, properties, there are basic problems with searching full text such as:
- addition of synonyms (you don't know what variations authors use) and by far the greatest challenge to search for text in full text databases is to cover synonyms
- related to this is the need for truncation (left- and right-), singulars/plurals, English/American spellings, participles of verbs (present, past, future, past perfect and so forth
- proximity of terms (on STN, in full text search databases you have nW, nA, nS, nP proximity options (n = you can put in number of intervening words; W in order specified, A in either order, S in sentence, P in paragraph.  And of course there is AND (anywhere in the document)
- words (called Stop Words) you don't want to search (or count), such as prepositions
- how to cover Greek letters, subscripts and superscripts and the like. 

On the other hand there were excellent features of DataSearch, particularly the ability to display figures/tables/diagrams (I have been pushing Reaxys to do this for three years!).  The general layout was super, colours were good, tabs were clearly indicated and so forth - meaning working through the mechanics of the workflow was super easy.

I do not know the Elsevier policies on DataSearch/Reaxys/Scopus (and other ELS products) but Reaxys (substances/reactions/properties) has hugely important and unique content, while Scopus has bibliometrics, various document analysis tools and so forth.  It should not be too difficult to make DataSearch interoperable with Reaxys/Scopus.  Having said that I note that the DataSearch engine was designed: ""We are interested in exploring what a search engine for research data would look like (as opposed to a web search engine or a document search engine), and are talking with users and data providers about their needs and interests.""

Sure - search engine for research data is a great idea, and sure - document search engines such as WebofScience/Scopus are well developed, and sure - in many fields of science text-based search engines are all that people need.  ""chip-seq drosophila"" and nearly all the other topics in biology, genetics, geology (although here you need a Geographic thesaurus), clinical medicine are very well searched by text (provided you have proximity operators), but chemistry not only is a (commercial) science in itself, but it also underpins so many other branches of science - so a ""search engine for research data"" simple has to tackle the issues with searching for substances, reactions,  properties ...

Another comment is that, throughout my days with STN, then SciFinder, and now with Reaxys I am constantly dismayed by the lack of interest by scientists in learning anything about searching and search techniques.  Why should scientists, for whom the two up-front characteristics are curiosity then skepticism, treat information retrieval as a dumb/blackbox?   I'd need to think about it (in relation to DataSearch), but I am sure there is some mid way, for developers of search engines, between treating scientists as dumb fools and yet requiring them to invest even just a little time in information retrieval.
